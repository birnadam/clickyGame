# clickyGame

## What it is
clickyGame is a memory game that was built with React. The assignment required breaking UI into components, managing component state, 
and responding to user events. *Stranger Things* characters are appended onto cards, and the user is to click on a 
card. Once the card is clicked, the cards get shuffled around and the user is to click on another card. This continues while it 
stores the choices made, once it hits a card user have already clicked the game ends.
